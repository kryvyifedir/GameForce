# Permission Sets and Groups
ScoreHub relies on two main permission set groups to give users access to the functionality:

## ScoreHub Admin
Gives full access to a ScoreHub app including "Measurements" and "Achievements" tabs so that admin users can set new measurements and/or achievements

NOTE: This permission set is meant to be assigned to the user during the development of new functionality

## ScoreHub User
Gives access to the main functionality of ScoreHub but doesn't include access to the configuration of the achievements and measurements

NOTE: All new functionality has to be tested using the user with this permission set group to make sure that regular users can properly use the ScoreHub
