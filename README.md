# ScoreHub

## What is ScoreHub?
ScoreHub is an open-source project that aims to bring an xbox/playstation-like achievements into Salesforce. Gamification is a proven and unobtrusive way to boost engagement and productivity by leveraging the natural competitive instinct in people. It can help employees develop their skills and be more motivated when they have goals to work towards. In fact, gamification can increase productivity by up to 40%! But when it comes to modern CRM and ERP systems this is a rather underutilized approach. ScoreHub aims to change that!
