## What is GameForce?
<sub>Note: This is a draft of readme file, it is going to be updated alongside the progress made in the repository.</sub>

GameForce is an opensource project that aims to bring a xbox/playstation-like achievemtns into Salesforce. Gamification is a proven and inobtrusive way to boost engagement and productivity by leveraging the natural competitive instinct in people. It can help employees develop their skills and be more motivated when they have goals to work towards. In fact, gamification can increase productivity by up to 40%! But when it comes to modern CRM and ERP systems this is a rather underutilized approach. GameForce aims to change that!

## Extending standard functionality with custom Achievements
GameForce provides a set of standard achievements that can be used right a way, once post instalation configuration is done (See standard set of achievements below). But, due to the nature of a business, standard achievements might not be enough to be an effective motivational tool. Luckily, GameForce supports creation of Custom Achievements and integration with custom logic through the means of platform events.
